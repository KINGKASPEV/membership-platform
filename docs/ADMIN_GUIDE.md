    - **Trends**: Line chart showing registration velocity.
    - **Distribution**: Bar chart showing where members are located (e.g., which LGAs have the most members).

## 2. Managing Members
Navigate to the **Members** page via the sidebar or "Quick Actions".

3. **Approve**: Click the green "Approve" button if the details are correct and known to the parish.
